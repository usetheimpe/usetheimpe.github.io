      <h2>Hi! I'm Yelim Kim, a UX researcher, product designer, and full-stack developer.</h2>
      <p>For the last 2 years, I've worked as a <span class="highlight">UX research assistant at UBC.</span>
       I'm interested in Multimodal User Interfaces, especially Voice User Interfaces.
       I recently submitted <span class="highlight">2 papers to the Designing Interactive System conference!</span> For one of the projects, I worked with <span class="highlight">'Samsung'</span> to create a VUI for their 
       smart washer.
       I'd worked as a <span class="highlight">full-stack developer for 3 years</span> before going to graduate school.
       I love programming, travelling and writing! I'm a <a href="https://twitter.com/IndexExchange/status/871804907216662528"><u class="underline">hackathon winner</u></a> and <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/%EC%BA%90%EB%82%98%EB%8B%A4_%EC%9B%8C%ED%82%B9%ED%99%80%EB%A6%AC%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4_%EB%85%B8%ED%95%98%EC%9A%B0.html?id=qES8MQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y"><u class="underline">published author.</u class="underline"></a>
       The first edition of my travel essay book was completely sold out!</p>

            <p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry,
              who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was
              small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles.
              There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this
              room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a
              table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big
              bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no
              garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called
              a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great
              whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was
              reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led
              down into the small, dark hole.</p>
            <p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing
              but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the
              broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all
              directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little
              cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had
              burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be
              seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the
              paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray
              as everything else.</p>
            <p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and
              wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left
              them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they
              were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy,
              who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the
              child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart
              whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the
              little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p>
            <p>Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not
              know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots,
              and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>
            <p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as
              her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with
              long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of
              his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him,
              and loved him dearly.</p>
            <p>Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and
              looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood
              in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was
              washing the dishes.</p>
            <p>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and
              Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming
              storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as
              they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from
              that direction also.</p>

            <p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry,
              who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was
              small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles.
              There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this
              room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a
              table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big
              bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no
              garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called
              a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great
              whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was
              reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led
              down into the small, dark hole.</p>
            <p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing
              but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the
              broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all
              directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little
              cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had
              burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be
              seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the
              paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray
              as everything else.</p>
            <p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and
              wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left
              them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they
              were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy,
              who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the
              child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart
              whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the
              little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p>
            <p>Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not
              know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots,
              and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>
            <p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as
              her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with
              long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of
              his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him,
              and loved him dearly.</p>
            <p>Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and
              looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood
              in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was
              washing the dishes.</p>
            <p>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and
              Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming
              storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as
              they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from
              that direction also.</p>
